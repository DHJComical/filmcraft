# filmcraft-ui-egui

FilmCraft's L5 egui frontend: panels, docking, commands, rendering and playback. Project edits
always dispatch engine commands; playback and monitor state belong to the frontend.

## Source playback

`source_playback.rs` auditions media independently of Program playback. It reuses MediaSource
decoding, output mapping, the device clock and the desktop play-ahead buffer. Only one monitor
owns the device at a time. Source frame jobs use the existing frame server and Source resolution.
The live project, undo stack and timeline playhead are unchanged. See [monitor documentation](../../docs/monitors.md)
for behavior, commands, limitations and regression tests. Source playback tests use synthetic
demo media and fake audio outputs; no third-party assets are introduced.

Source drag controls snapshot the selected span and dispatch `timeline.place` for video, audio,
or linked video/audio. Full-clip marks are implicit until set by the user. The engine owns edits,
range validation and undo; the UI owns the drag gesture. See `source_drag_ui` and the engine's
`source_placement_tests` for regression coverage.

Source range handles use transient gesture previews and the engine's integer-frame
`source_monitor::adjust_range`; release dispatches one mark edit. Monitor command routing
keeps Source navigation, markers and marked-range playback separate from Program.
